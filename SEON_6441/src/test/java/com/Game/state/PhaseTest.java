 * Phase.java is purely abstract and all its functionality is implemented in MapEditorPhase or other subclasses.
 * Since we already have a concrete subclass like MapEditorPhase that implements the functionality defined in 
 * Phase.java, we do not need to write a separate JUnit test for Phase.java. Instead, we can focus on testing 
 * the concrete subclass (MapEditorPhase) because:
 * Phase is an abstract class,testing the Subclass Covers the Abstract Class.
